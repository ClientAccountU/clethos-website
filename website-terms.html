        <p>These Website Terms (“Terms”) apply when you access or use the CLETHOS website and any related subdomains (the “Website”). The Website is run by or on behalf of CLETHOS (“we”, “us”, “our”). By using the Website you accept these Terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the Website.</p>

        <h2>1. Use of the Website</h2>
        <p>You may use the Website only for lawful purposes and in line with these Terms. You must not use it in any way that breaks applicable law, infringes others’ rights, or could harm, disable, or disrupt the Website or our systems. You must not try to gain unauthorised access to any part of the Website, our networks, or any data we hold.</p>

        <h2>2. No advice</h2>
        <p>Content on the Website (text, graphics, and other material) is for general information and marketing only. It is not legal, financial, tax, or other professional advice. Do not rely on it when making decisions. For advice that fits your situation, consult qualified professionals. Providing information on the Website does not create a client or advisory relationship between you and CLETHOS.</p>

        <h2>3. Accuracy and changes</h2>
        <p>We try to keep information on the Website accurate and up to date but do not warrant that it is complete, current, or free of errors. We may change the content, structure, or availability of the Website at any time without notice. We are not liable for any loss from relying on the Website or from changes we make.</p>

        <h2>4. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>CLETHOS (or its licensors) owns all rights in the Website and its content (design, text, images, logos, software). We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable licence to access and view the Website for personal or internal business use. You must not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or create derivative works from the Website or its content without our prior written consent, except where the law allows.</p>

        <h2>5. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your use of the Website is also subject to our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data. By using the Website you agree to that processing as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>6. Links to third-party sites</h2>
        <p>The Website may link to other websites. Those links are for convenience only. We do not control and are not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or availability of those sites. A link does not mean we endorse them. You use third-party sites at your own risk.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Website and its content are supplied “as is”. We exclude all warranties, express or implied, including as to accuracy, completeness, or fitness for a particular purpose.</li>
          <li>We do not promise that the Website will be uninterrupted, secure, or free from errors or harmful content.</li>
          <li>We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive loss or damage from your accessing or using (or being unable to use) the Website or its content, including loss of profits, data, or business opportunity, even if we have been told such loss might occur.</li>
          <li>These Terms do not exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Indemnity</h2>
        <p>You will indemnify CLETHOS and its affiliates and their officers, directors, and employees against any claims, losses, damages, and costs (including reasonable legal fees) that arise from your use of the Website in breach of these Terms or any applicable law.</p>

        <h2>9. Suspension and termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or end your access to the Website at any time, with or without notice, for any reason, including if we believe you have broken these Terms or for operational or security reasons. We are not liable to you for that suspension or termination.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to these Terms</h2>
        <p>We may change these Website Terms from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date when we do. If you keep using the Website after changes are posted, you accept the new Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Website.</p>

        <h2>11. General</h2>
        <p>These Terms are the entire agreement between you and CLETHOS about use of the Website. No waiver of any term is effective unless in writing. If any term is invalid or unenforceable, the rest stays in effect. You may not assign your rights or obligations; we may assign without restriction. No third party has rights under these Terms.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. The courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute about these Terms or the Website.</p>
